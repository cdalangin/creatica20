# Quick Meals

Quick Meals serves personalized meals based on your set of criteria to make your time in the kitchen easier!

### Inspiration
When we were discussing our project, we saw that all of us are fond of the idea of cooking. Eventually, we started to brainstorm ways we can relate the topic of cooking with helping others. We understand for some of our peers, it could be difficult to prepare meals. They either donâ€™t have the time, ingredients, or equipment, to do so. Others may want to look for meals that cater to their specific needs. Therefore, we decided to create a platform that gives an easy and fun way to discover new meals based on their criteria.
